Roadmap of Future Improvements

After finishing this project, I think it would be worth implementing an AI opponent so that the game did not require two separate players, it could be one person versus the computer. This might be done with some kind of algorithm that analyzes all possible moves available and to choose the most efficient answer

In addition to this, there could be a scorekeeping component as well that could keep track of players and their wins with a JSON file that kept track, or it could be stored locally in temporary web files. It could score wins, losses, and ties individually or between two opponents who regularly played. 

Also, there are many designs that could be implemented to make it more aesthetically pleasing, and even incorporate some more advanced art for the board and pieces.
